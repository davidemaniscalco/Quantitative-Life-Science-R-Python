# Quantitative_Life_Science-R-Python
Final project, about memory recall, of the QLS course from the master degree in Physics of Data

This folder contains:

- Articles folder: folder containing the scientific papers that have been studied to do the project
- Files and files_new_idea folders: contain the data produced by the simulations. These data are used to do the plots
- QLS.pdf file: file of the presentation of the project
- Python_graphics notebook: notebook used to make the plots
- R_code: commented notebook that contains some of the functions used for the simulations. Useful to understand the meaning of the functions
- Recall_script: script used to make the simulations. It just has to be run: the input parameters are taken from the Config.R file, and the output are placed in the files folder
- Config.R file: editable file that contains the input parameters that are read from the script
